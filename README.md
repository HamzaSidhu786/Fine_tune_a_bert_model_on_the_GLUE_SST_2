# **Fine tune Bert Model for classification**
In this Notebook you will learn how to  transformer based large language model on your own dataset

- preprocess a text dataset

  - Load dataset
  - Analyze features and target
  - Tokenize text
  - add padding to make same length
  - Convert Dict to Tensorflow dataset for trainable keras model
- Optimize the model
  - You will learn how to optimize the model hyperparameters
- Train model on your own prepared dataset
- Evaluate your trained model
  - You will learn how to evaluate model 'accuracy' and 'f1' score
